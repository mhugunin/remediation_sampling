Project code for Planning Techniques for Robots

Authors: Hannah He, Mithril Hugunin, Grayson Moyer


How to run:
Execute testautomator.m to run a demo from preset conditions

To run other configurations, change the following indices as defined in testautomator:
map_ind = N;
source_ind = N;
start_ind = N;

Not all index combinations will be valid, as the map occupancy changes where valid locations for the bot and sources are.
